# login-form
A simple C++ User Authentication System that allows users to Sign Up, Log In, and Reset Password using file handling.

Features
Sign-Up: Users can create an account by entering their username, email, and password.
Login: Users can log in by entering their username and password.
Forgot Password: Users can reset their password by providing their username and registered email.
Persistent Storage: User credentials are stored in a file (login_info.txt) for authentication.

How It Works
Sign Up: Creates a new user account and saves credentials in login_info.txt.
Login: Checks the credentials from login_info.txt and allows access if valid.
Forget Password: If a user forgets their password, they can reset it using their username and email.

Future Enhancements
✅ Encrypt passwords for better security
✅ Store data in a database instead of a file
